Reminiscens tablet application and RESTful API
===================================================================

Reminiscens is a social informatics project funded by the <a href="http://www.lifeparticipation.org/"> 
Lifeparticipation Research Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.disi.unitn.it/"> University of Trento </a>. It is 
the result of participatory research action and design with local elders, with the goal of motivating face to face 
social interactions between older adults and their younger relatives. Not only we have worked on designing an 
application, but we have worked to build an interesting knowledge base of content that will stimulate people to 
reminisce. 

Reminiscens is a work in progress, part of a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies. In this respository, 
you will find the codebase for the RESTful API and frontend UI of the tablet app. 

The RESTful API provides HTTP access to resources that support the Reminiscens' tablet app, with the goal of 
stimulating elderly and their families in sharing memories and motivate conversation by exploring content related 
to these memories' place and period of time. The goal is to stimulate a healthy practice of positive reminiscence 
that will benefit elders' subjective wellbeing. 

The API is developed partly in Java, using the play framework, and partly in Ruby (check https://github.com/cdparra/lifecontext). 
For the UI, we are using web technologies (jQuery, twitter bootstrap, backbone.js) and wrapping everything up with 
phonegap. 

Please, be gentle. This is all work-in-progress made by students that learning by doing :-). Of course, feedback is always
